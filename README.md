## Introduction

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where malicious actors create fake websites that look identical to legitimate ones, trying to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Our URL Phishing Detection system helps protect users by automatically identifying these dangerous websites by analyzing their web addresses (URLs).

Think of it like a security guard for the internet: when you're about to visit a website, our system quickly checks if the website address looks suspicious, just like how a security guard might check if someone's ID looks fake.

## Glossary of Terms

### Basic Terms
- **URL**: A web address (like www.example.com) that tells your browser where to find a website
- **Phishing**: A cyber attack that uses fake websites to steal personal information
- **Machine Learning**: A way to teach computers to make decisions by showing them many examples
- **Model**: A computer program that has learned to make predictions based on past data
- **Feature**: A specific piece of information used to make a decision (like the length of a URL)

### Technical Terms
- **Random Forest**: A prediction method that combines many simple decision trees to make better decisions
- **ROC Curve**: A graph that shows how well the model balances catching bad URLs vs. falsely flagging good ones
- **F1-Score**: A number between 0 and 1 that tells us how accurate our model is (1 being perfect)
- **Cross-validation**: A way to test our model by training it on different parts of our data
- **False Positive**: When we incorrectly flag a safe URL as dangerous
- **False Negative**: When we miss a dangerous URL and mark it as safe
- **API**: A way for different computer programs to talk to each other
- **Frontend/Backend**: Frontend is what users see and interact with; backend is where the processing happens

### Advanced Terms
- **GridSearchCV**: A method to automatically find the best settings for our model
- **Feature Extraction**: The process of converting a URL into numbers that our model can understand
- **Hyperparameter**: Settings we can adjust to make our model work better
- **Ensemble Method**: Combining multiple models to make better predictions

## Model Overview

Our URL Phishing Detection system works like a highly trained security expert who has studied millions of website addresses. Here's how it works in simple terms:

1. **Input**: A user provides a website address they want to check
2. **Analysis**: Our system looks at 18 different aspects of the URL, such as:
   - How long is the address?
   - Does it use unusual characters?
   - Does it try to mimic a known website?
3. **Decision**: Based on these checks, it decides if the URL is safe or dangerous

### Key Components Explained
- **Algorithm**: We use a "Random Forest Classifier" - imagine having 200 security experts each looking at the URL and voting on whether it's dangerous
- **Feature Extraction**: Like a detective looking for clues, we analyze 18 different aspects of each URL
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly website where anyone can check if a URL is safe

## System Architecture

Our URL Phishing Detection system is built with a modular architecture that ensures efficient processing and accurate predictions. Here's a detailed look at how the system works:

    end
```

The system architecture diagram above shows:
1. **User Interface**: A web-based interface where users can input URLs or upload QR codes
2. **Backend Processing**: Flask-based server that handles requests and coordinates the detection process
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts 18 distinct features from URLs (detailed below)
4. **Model Training**: Shows how our Random Forest model was trained and optimized

### Feature Extraction Process

The feature extraction is a critical component that transforms URLs into meaningful numerical features:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input URL] --> B[URL Parser]
    B --> C[Length Features]
    B --> D[Character Features]
    B --> E[Security Features]
    
    subgraph Length Features
        C --> C1[URL Length]
        C --> C2[Domain Length]
        C --> C3[Path Length]
        C --> C4[Subdomain Length]
        C --> C5[TLD Length]
    end
    
    subgraph Character Features
        D --> D1[Special Chars]
        D --> D2[Digit Count]
        D --> D3[@Symbol]
        D --> D4[IP Detection]
        D --> D5[Underscore Count]
        D --> D6[Percent Symbol Count]
        D --> D7[Hash Symbol Count]
    end
    
    subgraph Security Features
        E --> E1[HTTPS]
        E --> E2[Dots Count]
        E --> E3[Hyphens]
        E --> E4[Domain Tokens]
        E --> E5[Query Params]
        E --> E6[Ampersand Count]
    end
```

Our feature extractor processes URLs in three main categories:
1. **Length Features**: Analyzes various length-based characteristics (5 features)
   - URL total length
   - Domain length
   - Path length
   - Subdomain length
   - TLD length

2. **Character Features**: Examines character patterns (7 features)
   - Special character count
   - Digit count
   - @ symbol presence
   - IP address detection
   - Underscore count
   - Percent symbol count
   - Hash symbol count

3. **Security Features**: Checks security-related indicators (6 features)
   - HTTPS usage
   - Dot count
   - Hyphen usage
   - Domain token count
   - Query parameter count
   - Ampersand count

All these features (total of 18) are implemented in our `URLFeatureExtractor` class and have been proven effective in identifying phishing URLs.
